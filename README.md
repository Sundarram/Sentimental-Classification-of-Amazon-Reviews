# Sentimental-Classification-of-Amazon-Reviews
The goal of this project was to classify more than 50,000 online user reviews into 5 different classes, identifying their respective star ratings. There were in total 3 datasets and each dataset was split into 3 groups of training, validation and testing sets. All the three datasets were obtained from 6 categories mainly: apparel, automotivs, books, dvd, music and hotels (TripAdvisor). The objective was to predict labels for the test data to achieve as high an accuracy as possible above the given baseline using provided three vector representations: TF-IDF, LSA and PCA of the 5-gram features of the reviews. Used Scikit-Learn (ML) toolbox in Python.
